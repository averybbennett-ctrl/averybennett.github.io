## About Me

I am a third-year Honours Economics student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in Econometrics. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep interest in applying quantitative methods to complex economic questions, combining rigorous statistical analysis with a nuanced understanding of economic theory and history. 

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have cultivated expertise in econometrics, microeconomic theory, and the historical evolution of economic thought, exploring how past policies inform contemporary economic challenges. My coursework and research projects have provided extensive experience in data analysis, regression modeling, and empirical evaluation, equipping me with the tools to analyze real-world economic phenomena critically and systematically.

Looking past graduation in 2027, I plan to continue my studies by pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics, with the goal of contributing to research and policy development that bridges theoretical insight with practical application.
